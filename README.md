Azure deployment of marketplace offering (Application offer) and verification

* Currently no way to test the Azure marketplace offers deployment
* Licensing TCs (PAYG / BYOL verification) are manually tested during each publication
* Frequent ‘marketplace UI’/’UI processing’ changes cause deployment failures and these are not caught in-time
* Once automated we can extend the existing automation pipelines to MP offers as well

We intend to automate the MP offer deployment for FTDv and verify the successful deployment and licensing mode. 
This can be later extended to automate the pre/post release sanity TCs required for publication of new versions.
